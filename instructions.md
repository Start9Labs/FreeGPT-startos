# Using FreeGPT on StartOS

## Important Warnings!
   - FreeGPT has *no authentication*. If someone gets ahold your unique Tor address, they will be able to see you entire cht history and use your server to generate chats of their own.
   - This service is in *early stage* development
   - Minimal functionality and some bugs are expected
   - This service can use significant system resources. Beware when running it alongside other services that use significant system resources, such as Bitcoin or electrs.
   - Avoid clicking quickly. If clicking a button appears to have no effect, *wait*! It is likely things are just taking time to process.

## Download a Large Language Model (LLM)
   - In the FreeGPT interface click on "DOWNLOAD MODELS"
   - Choose a language model from the list provided. Models are automatically filtered based on the available RAM of your server. Larger models should provide better responses, but they will be slower.

## Start a Chat
   - After downloading at least one language model, click "NEW CHAT"
   - Optionally adjust settings for this new chat. We recommend using the default unless you really know what you are doing.
